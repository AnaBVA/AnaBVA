Before working in bioinformatics, I did wet lab expirience working with spermatogenesis in high-school, and later in hepatocarcinogenesis for my undergrad thesis in [Saúl Villa-Treviño](https://www.cell.cinvestav.mx/depto.php?lang=es&tit=4&subt=1&subsubt=11)'s lab. I characterized the protein expression of Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein II (IGFBP2) during the develompent of cancer in rat livers using blood and tissue.  

I graduated from the [Undergraduate Program on Biochemical Engineering](https://www.encb.ipn.mx/licenciatura/ingenieriaBioquimica/index.html) at National Biological Sience School ([ENCB](https://www.encb.ipn.mx/Paginas/index.html)), [IPN](https://www.ipn.mx/) in 2012.


After that, I attended and graduated from the [Master of Science in cell biology](https://www.cell.cinvestav.mx/depto.php?lang=es&tit=1) programm at [CINVESTAV](https://www.cinvestav.mx/) in [Guillermo Elizondo-Azuela](https://www.cell.cinvestav.mx/depto.php?lang=es&tit=4&subt=1&subsubt=6)'s lab in collaboration with [Paul Boutros](https://labs.oicr.on.ca/boutros-lab/software). My master's thesis aim was to unscramble the alternative splicing effects of TCDD in C57BL6 mouse hepatocytes using high-throughput data.
