### Projects

* Worked in collaboration with [Mina Ryten](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ukpdc/research-groups/neurogenomics-group/mina-ryten)'s lab at [University College London's Institute of Neurology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/) to analyze [Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)](https://www.gtexportal.org/) project data to explore gene expression variability across brain regions
    - Analyzed GTEx brain samples from [recount2](http://bioconductor.org/packages/recount) using [recount.bwtool](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/recount.bwtool) with [JHPCE](https://jhpce.jhu.edu), a high-performance computing environment
* Capstone: Applying Statistical Correction for Brain Tissue Degradation to Gene Expression in Schizophrenia 
    - Analyzed postmortem human brain RNA-sequencing data in [R](https://cran.r-project.org) using [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) packages with [JHPCE](https://jhpce.jhu.edu)
